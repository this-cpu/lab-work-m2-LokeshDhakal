## Title  : Basic sound processing and manipulation using python.

## Objectives  :  
  1. Load and play a sample sound clip (drum wave)
  2. Process and manipulate audio signal
  3. Perform audio synthesis using sign wave
  4. Visualize audio waveform and spectrum properties

## Background Theory
  - Sound and audio representation
  - Sampling and Quantization
  - Pylab
  - Librosa

## Procedure
During the experiment, I worked on two notebooks: working with sounds.ipynb and audio synthesis.ipynb. In the first notebook, I loaded the drum.wav file and tried
out basic audio manipulation by clipping the first 2000 milliseconds of the sound. I exported this piece as clipped_drum.wav and played it back to clearly hear how
the audio changes when only a small segment is taken. I also explored simple sampling, resampling, and waveform visualization to get a better feel for how the
signal behaves.

In the second notebook, audio synthesis.ipynb, I created my own audio tone using a sine wave and compared its waveform and frequency pattern with the actual drum
sound. I also used Google Gemini to generate an AI-based audio sample, which gave me a different perspective on synthesized versus real audio. Overall, these steps
helped me understand how to load, segment, synthesize, and visualize audio in a practical and hands-on way.

## Output

I generated several interesting audio outputs through this lab. The clipped drum segment from sounds.ipynb, along with its waveform and spectrum visualizations,
really helped me understand how segmentation works in practice. The synthesized sine wave from audio synthesis.ipynb let me directly compare artificial and natural
sounds, while the AI-generated drum sample from Google Gemini showed me how AI can creatively transform audio in unexpected ways. Working hands-on with these
outputs made the concepts of audio segmentation, synthesis, and visualization much clearer than just reading about them.
